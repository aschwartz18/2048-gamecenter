=============================================================================================
1. Pieces that have been correctly implemented:
	- Program loads rodeo.json correctly
	- Program renders Google Maps
	- Program uses unique markers to print T stations of correct line to map
	- Program uses colored polylines to connect T stations
	- Program finds current location, prints lat and long and distance to nearest T station

   Pieces that have yet to be implemented:
   	- Station markers don't show station name or schedule
   	- Program displays 500 error message in console when rodeo.json displays error
   	- Polylines in red line don't fork correctly

2. I discussed the assignment with a Comp20 TA.

3. I spent approximately 8 hours completing the assignment.
