1. Pieces that have been correctly implemented:
	- Program loads rodeo.json correctly
	- Program renders Google Maps
	- Program uses unique markers to print T stations of correct line to map
	- Program uses colored polylines to connect T stations
	- Red line polylines fork correctly
	- Program finds current location, prints lat and long and distance to nearest T station
	- Program displays 500 error message in console when rodeo.json displays error

   Pieces that have yet to be implemented:
   	- Station markers don't show station name or schedule
